</header>

<main>
    <p>As a yoruba girl from the western part of Nigeria (Osun state precisely), 
    we have numerous delicious dishes but my favourite is <b>MoiMoi</b></p> 

    <p>MoiMoi (also called MoinMoin or Olele by some people)is a steamed or boiled pudding made from a mixture of washed and peeled beans, in combination with onions and fresh red peppers such as chili, bell peppers or scotch bonnet peppers</p>

    <p>This dish is native to the yoruba tribe and it originated from this tribe. MoiMoi is a protein rich food and its interesting to know that it is also eaten in countries such as Ghana and Sierra Leone</p>

    <p>MoiMoi is a very versatile dish, it can be eaten as a main meal , snack or as a side dish. It can be served with Pap, Garri, Custard or as a side dish alongside jollof rice, fried rice, cole slaw and other dishes. It is common to find moimoi served at nigerian parties. It is also common practice for household to make this delicacy on weekends when they have time <strong>(it can take some time to prepare it!)</strong></p>

    <h2>Steps to prepare MoiMoi</h2>
    <p>Here is a concise list of steps involved in the production of moimoi</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step is to soak (for about two hours) and wash your beans to soften and remove its coat. Once this is done, put the beans in a bowl and pour enough water to cover it, let it soak for about two hours more in order to achieve the best consistency when you blend it</li>
        <li>If you decide to use eggs; boil it and slice it into smaller pieces. For fish, debone and boil it then set it aside</li>
        <li>If you are using leaves , wash it and set it aside. If you are using tins or aluminium foil also wash and set aside</li>
        <li>Now wash the peppers and onions, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>It is time to blend the beans, peppers and onions, crayfish and some water using a very good blender</li>
        <li>Pour the mix in a big bowl and add your veegtable oil and seasoning. Slowly add water if needed and stir the mixture thoroughly</li>
        <li>Now fold the leaves into a cone shape and dish the moimoi, then add your egg, fish, corn beef and set it in the pot containing some water </li>
        <li>Cover your pot and cook for up to 40minutes. To check if its ready, put a knife through it. If the knife is stained with MoiMoi paste then it is not done. If it comes out clean its done</li>
    </ol>
